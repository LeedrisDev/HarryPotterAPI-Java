# Harry Potter API


## Description

Hogwarts is a renowned school of magic, and it is embracing modernization! In order to adapt to the changing times, 
the school has decided to introduce a smartphone application for classroom bookings, making it more convenient for students.

This project involves the development of a backend application and its associated database for managing classroom 
reservations at Hogwarts. The application will provide an easy-to-use interface for students to book classrooms for 
various purposes, such as revision sessions or group study.
